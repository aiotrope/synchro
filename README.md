## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Entries

Date Started(Backend): 22.1.2023 - 28.2.2023

Date Started(Frontend): 31.1.2023 - 28.2.2023

Links to my contributions to this project are provided, as well as a detailed breakdown of the time I allocate to it. Some of my hours are also spent on this [abandoned repository](https://github.com/aiotrope/synchro-frontend) during the early stages of development. Initially I intended to deploy the backend and frontend separately on different hosting providers, but an issue emerged later on, and I had to integrate the backend and frontend together.
